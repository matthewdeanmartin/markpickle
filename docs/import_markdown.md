# Idea

1. What if you could write functions in code blocks and import the file as a module?
1. What if you could execute a .md file and all the python code blocks would run as if the markdown were comments?
1. What if you could treat a .md file as a template language with code blocks with python that will output MD or HTML?
1. What if the code block was just a holder for the repr of an python object?

## Yes, but, well...

1. This is sort of interesting and it kind of already works in pycharm.
1. Not revolutionary, but nice I guess.
1. Template languages are such a crowded space and this is weak templating language (the power of markdown + print)
1. As a standalone format, not interesting, it is just repr wrapped in as code-fence
